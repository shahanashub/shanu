This Simple Calculator program is written in C and performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program utilizes a switch statement to handle user input for selecting operations and includes an if-else statement within the division case to manage division by zero. If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program outputs a clear message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.
